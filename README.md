# InterAppSample

With the Viva Wallet card terminal app for Android it is possible to receive requests for initiating transactions from third-party apps installed on the same Android mobile device. Communication with the card terminal app is done through the use of Android **intents**. The client app creates an intent with parameters and starts the card terminal app’s pay activity. When the card terminal app’s pay activity finishes it returns the result to the caller app.
